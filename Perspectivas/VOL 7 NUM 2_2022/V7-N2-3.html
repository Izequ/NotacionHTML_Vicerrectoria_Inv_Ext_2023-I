                    This research with a post-structuralist epistemological approach and qualitative methodology had the
                    objective
                    of revealing the conditions that make it possible for the parenting practices of caregivers of early
                    childhood
                    children in family and educational contexts to be configured as technologies of power (procedures
                    through
                    which power relations are socially legitimized). Likewise, it was proposed to demonstrate the
                    self-care practices
                    of children configured as technologies of the self. The results made it possible to identify current
                    parenting
                    practices where discipline practices are still evident in both contexts. It is concluded that power
                    relations arise
                    in the middle of a relational triad school - family - childhood, in an apparently functional gear,
                    thus, children are
                    influenced by the processes of both entities and begin to witness how the family has become
                    Foucault's terms
                    in an "institution". Part of the practices carried out by adults are incorporated by children and
                    become self-care
                    practices that, according to the analysis obtained, are part of a powerful formation of technologies
                    of the self,
                    however, not so well achieved. at this age, but a strong constitution is expected in the next stages
                    of the life
                    cycle.

                    Esta investigación de enfoque epistemológico post estructuralista y metodología cualitativa tuvo
                    como objetivo,
                    develar las condiciones que hacen posible que las prácticas de crianza de los cuidadores de niños de
                    primera
                    infancia en los contextos familiar y educativo se configuren como tecnologías de poder
                    (procedimientos mediante
                    los cuales socialmente se legitiman relaciones de poder). Así mismo, se propuso evidenciar las
                    prácticas de auto
                    cuidado de los niños configuradas como tecnologías del yo. Los resultados permitieron identificar
                    prácticas
                    vigentes en la crianza donde aún se evidencian prácticas de disciplinamiento en ambos contextos. Se
                    concluye
                    que, las relaciones de poder surgen en medio de una triada relacional escuela – familia – infancia,
                    en un
                    engranaje aparentemente funcional, así, niños son influenciados por los procesos de ambos entes y se
                    empieza a
                    presenciar como la familia se ha convertido en términos de Foucault en una “institución”. Parte de
                    las prácticas
                    ejecutadas por los adultos son incorporadas por los niños y niñas y se convierten en prácticas de
                    auto cuidado
                    que, según el análisis logrado, estas si hacen parte de una potente formación de tecnologías del yo,
                    sin embargo,
                    no tan bien logradas en esta edad, pero si se espera una constitución fuerte en las próximas etapas
                    del ciclo vital.

        <p class="titulo"> Introduction</p>

        <p>
            Currently, there are many actions aimed at
            comprehensive care that seek to increase the quality
            of life of children around the world, based on the
            hypothesis that, by working for today's children,
            progress is guaranteed of each country and the life
            in society of said beneficiaries is facilitated. Thus,
            recognizing that the family is where the process of
            guaranteeing rights and socialization with the world
            begins, it is essential to carry out investigations in
            favor of all the processes that are evidenced within
            them, since children even in their early years are
            surrounded by attentions, behaviors, concepts,
            and practices that strengthen their development or,
            on the contrary, may impair it, as the case may be
            (Restrepo-Segura, & García-Peña, 2021).
        </p>

        <P>
            This research focuses on those practices used for
            the training of children by some of their significant
            adults. By identifying certain practices that improve
            the development process, the efforts made by the
            state to guarantee integral development will be
            increased, in this way, a contribution from this
            research will be related to those significant actions
            that favor the attempts and plans of the state and the
            co-responsible for childhood, including parents and
            caregivers.
        </P>

        <P>
            A key objective in the results of this research is
            to analyze parenting practices from the Foucaultian
            perspective as power relations; The understanding
            of the primary and secondary socialization scenarios
            in the family setting and the educational setting as
            spaces that generate power relations and legitimize
            said practices is a novel vision, taking into account
            that the contributions of the postmodernist theorist
            were always maintained in institutions but not
            directly approximate to the first years of life of
            human beings.
        </P>

        <P>
            In this order of ideas, three analytical categories
            are determined: first, parenting practices that
            refer to the actions that people carry out in favor
            of the development of children in the form of intentional and regulated actions (Aguirre-Dávila
            & Morales-Castillo, 2022; Aguirre-Dávila et al.,
            2021). The second category, power relations,
            conceptualized by Foucault (2003) as objective
            capacities, communication and behavior relations
            that configure the actions of free subjects. The third
            category determined as the technologies of the self,
            are defined as operations on the body and soul of
            the subject himself, in search of the transformation
            of themselves and of happiness that begins on their
            own or with the help of others (Foucault, 2016).
        </P>

        <P>
            In summary, this research, supported by the
            search for symbolisms and representations within
            the family nucleus and the work of educational
            agents around children, sustains a fundamental value
            paying great attention to discourse and practice in
            the historical context in which they appeared and
            occurred. they produced effects of knowledge, truth,
            and power; From the beginning, it was conceived as
            an investigative hypothesis that parenting practices
            are configured as power relations and, likewise,
            these practices generate self-care practices in boys
            and girls that can become technologies of the self.
        </P>


        <!-- Metodología y materiales -->
        <hr>

        <p class="titulo">Methodology</p>

        <p>
            The methodological approach of this research
            considered appropriate and closer to its interests, the
            inclusion of the interpretive view from the position of
            critical hermeneutics as an epistemological approach.
            Critical hermeneutics is considered a hermeneutic of
            suspicion, of the interpretation of hidden links, and
            is even inclusive, sharing and trying to complement
            other theories (Recas Bayón, 2007). In addition
            to expressing the totality about an event, it deals
            with making visible what the granting of meaning
            hides, conceals or distorts, being an implication of
            the dynamics of language, coercive forms of power
            or dominance. The critical hermeneutical approach
            proposed implies giving important value to the
            interpretation of the problematized experiences
            (Habermas, 2019, 2018).
        </p>

        <P>
            In conjunction with the objectives and
            expectations of this research, it was convenient to
            use a qualitative methodology and as one of the main
            reasons it is found that qualitative research responds
            to the interests of this research, since a relevant way
            of approaching the execution of parenting practices
            by parents and the discourses that support them is
            favorable from the use of interviews, observations
            of the environment, content or discourse analysis,
            or others. According to Sandoval Casillimas
            (2011), it was decided for the present investigation
            the moments of the qualitative model that he calls
            common for almost all research studies, among
            them, the moments of formulation, design, and
            management. Hereafter, the description of the design
            and management moment is provided.
        </P>

        <P>
            This research was of immediate interest on the
            power relations between caregivers - children in
            family and educational contexts in the municipality
            of San José de Cúcuta (unit of analysis). The
            categories to be considered empirically within the
            unit of analysis correspond to all those behaviors
            generated by parents and caregivers of children in
            relation to their development and training process;
            Likewise, he paid attention to power relations, the
            conditions that configure them and those actions that
            children may be executing as authors of their own
            destiny in favor of self-care.
        </P>

        <P>
            In terms of the work unit, 4 boys and 2 girls
            were selected as participating subjects, randomly
            selected from 180 children attending an institution
            for comprehensive early childhood care; the program
            benefits children in early childhood from 2 years and
            8 months to 5 years belonging to socioeconomic
            strata 1 and 2 according to SISBEN. Likewise, the
            significant adults of the children were involved in
            the work unit, in this case, 2 educational agents
            and the 6 adult guardians of the selected children,
            preferably mother or grandmother, depending on the
            case, who spends the most time with the children,
            to collect as much information as possible in the
            interview process.
        </P>

        <P>
            In the same way, for the collection of the
            information, those techniques that easily and
            truthfully support the achievement of the objectives
            in a greater correspondence than any other technique
            were selected with caution. Considering that
            different age groups (children and adults) were
            handled, the information gathering techniques were
            determined based on this. For the group of adults,
            the semi-structured interview was used as interviews
            aimed at learning about events and activities that
            cannot be observed directly, where the participants
            are complete informants and describe in detail what
            happens (Taylor et al., 2015).
        </P>

        <P>
            For the information gathering technique with
            the children, an instrument composed of images
            that make up comic strips was designed, with a
            projective intention; some of the images were taken
            from the projective test called the Düss Fables and
            adapted to research based on Foucault's theoretical
            construct on the technologies of the self and selfcare, for which a review of three key texts was made
            to identify possible characteristics of the construct:
            the government of oneself and others (Foucault,
            2011), technologies of the self and other related texts
            (Foucault, 2016) and the hermeneutics of the subject
            (Foucault, 2005).
        </P>

        <P>
            Each image responds to the aspects or behaviors
            that Foucault (Foucault, 2016) in his theoretical
            review in the three texts considers about technologies
            of the self and practices of self-care; projective
            images are presented to children with an opening
            question and in some cases carry a description of the
            situation for the child. Each situation as proposed
            must respond to the following aspects: 1. Selfknowledge or ability to self-evaluate, 2. Rules of

            by the analysis phase, in which the intensive analysis
            method is used in this research, through which a
            discovery process is carried out in progress, through the identification of themes and / or categories and
            the propositions that accompany them (data or

            Two decades ago, children in early childhood
            spent more time at home, accompanied by relatives,
            were in maternal care (if possible) and were
            superfluously instructed at home to prepare in some
            way for entering school. Currently, children spend
            most of their time in scholastic spaces outside the
            family context, which implies a greater involvement
            of relationships with the world, an opening at an early
            age to the social situation and this without including
            the ease of access to education world information
            from the media and new technological models. It is
            worth describing that some children already know
            how to write, read, and count before the age of 5,
            where this was previously seen after the age of 6 and
            counting on having quality academic instruction.
        </p>

        <p>
            And although children today seem more
            independent and socially involved, the need to train
            adults depends on discipline practices. Well, it is
            essential to clarify this expression, since in fact not all
            actions carried out by adults are oriented to control,
            or are they? Well Foucault (2009) defines discipline
            as the mechanism of power that manages to control
            the social body, controls individuals, establishes
            their behaviors, guides and defines and uses
            surveillance, sanction and examination practices for
            their maintenance. To the above, if considers some
            of the actions of adults towards children, whether,
            in the family or at school, similarities will be found,
            but, in fact, a parent or teacher may claim that they
            must control their son or daughter because they do
            not know what is right or wrong and are at risk of
            getting hurt or falling into danger.
        </p>

        <p>
            Applicable to all contexts, what an adult refers
            to about the need to care for children is true, even
            the laws and regulations established by the state give
            priority to children, especially in early childhood (de
            la Nación, 2006). But, what is behind this interest in well-being? What is behind the need to verify
            their behavior? What is hidden in the verbalizations
            of parents when they punish and submit or, on the
            contrary, when they reward and motivate appearance
            of behaviors? Likewise, there is the question about
            the coherence between what the state has raised
            regarding the training of younger citizens and the
            practices that are actually sustained in reality.
        </p>

        <p>
            To open up a possible visibility of power relations
            between children and their adult caregivers, it is
            essential to focus on practices, hence Foucault (2003)
            uses the term "behavior" to facilitate the exploration
            of relationships, reinforcing a Again, relationships
            are intangible and invisible, but particular actions
            reveal their structure. In other words, in the first
            moment of this discussion, the practices carried out
            by adult caregivers will be compared with the theory
            in search of similarities or differences to determine
            the existence of a power and its relationship mode.

            Based on the results collected from the
            applied instruments, parenting practices in general
            at home and at school are exposed to physical
            care, the incorporation of behavioral norms and
            the development of cognitive skills for school
            performance. Aguirre-Dávila & Morales-Castillo
            (2022) considers that in parenting practices, adults
            attend to specific behaviors of their children,
            providing care in feeding, satisfying the demand for
            affection and correcting behaviors against the norm.
            Then, it can be affirmed that adults in the family
            environment carry out said practices described by
            Aguirre-Dávila (2022; 2021), and that is also the
            case with adults in the educational environment,
            whereby somewhat similar actions they are kept in a
            parenting parallel.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although Aguirre-Dávila et al., (2021) clarifies
            that parenting practices are part of family relationships
            (Aguirre-Dávila & Morales-Castillo, 2022), it can
            be observed that the behaviors developed in school
            have the same characteristics and apparently a
            similar purpose, which will not be deduced at this
            time, will be developed later. For now, it is possible to establish that there are parenting practices both
            in
            the family and in the educational environment. To
            continue, these practices will be specified, but closer
            to Foucault's theory.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is clarified that it has not yet been said that
            the parenting practices, both in the family and in the
            school of the children under study, are the product
            of discipline, that will now be established through
            what Foucault called disciplinary power techniques
            (Foucault, 2009). In the first place, Foucault
            affirms that, to consider behaviors as techniques
            of disciplinary power, they must be oriented in the
            following classifications: the distribution of bodies,
            control of activities, organization of genesis and the
            composition of forces.
        </p>

        <p>
            Foucault (2012) specifies that discipline takes
            advantage of exercises such as sanction and reward
            to continue controlling; In this sense, children
            recognize the relationship between meeting the
            established time and receiving a “happy face” or
            having to stay longer finishing their work while
            others play. At home, adults also take advantage of
            the system of punishments or rewards in meeting
            schedules, some with appetizing incentives such as
            sweets or promises to take you somewhere.
        </p>

        <p>
            The constant and daily execution of activities in
            the family context and in the educational context is
            called habit, which is the main task of both entities:
            the achievement of the children incorporating
            certain habits for their daily lives; For Foucault, this
            becomes repetitive tasks imposed as a product of
            adult knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
            The composition of forces is notorious as a
            technology of disciplinary power, since, at home, it
            is the children who are at the bottom of the hierarchy,
            and in the same way it is at school. It is their adults
            who decide what is right or wrong for them; “mom
            and dad tell her because they are the ones in charge”
            are the words of a girl when she inquired about why
            the mother in the cartoon sends her daughter to brush
            her teeth, bathe and have breakfast.
        </p>

        <p>
            At school, the rhythm is the same, the teacher
            is above all children and demands respect and
            obedience from them. It is also evident that her
            status as a teacher places her hierarchically above
            the parents. This is deduced from the fact that parents
            consider the teachers and the educational institution
            as a support that carries out the parenting process,
            since they must comply with other obligations that
            limit their time.
        </p>

        <p>
            It can be clarified with the previous paragraphs,
            that technologies of disciplinary power do occur, but
            these are stipulated in the family in one way and in
            the school in another, which we will delve into below,
            addressing the techniques to generate discipline
            individuality. Each child must meet a number of
            conditions to be a "good child" throughout the day,
            this exposes him as a subject in a power relationship,
            since his actions are awaiting the assessment of
            adults, and during the day it will be adjusted to
            actions of vigilance and normalizing sanction to
            fulfill the expectations of the adult.
        </p>

        <p>
            Parents and teachers spend most of their time
            monitoring the fulfillment of requests, among
            which the child follows instructions and obeys; But,
            when one of the surveillance entities is missing,
            the children act at their will, what the teachers in
            their activity program call “free play”; It is a space
            without restrictions, where the children are not in an
            imposed activity, however the teacher is still in the
            classroom to handle situations that get out of control
            and that is where the normalizing sanction appears.
            The normalizing sanction seeks to differentiate
            individuals and draw the border between normal and
            abnormal (Urízar Herrera 2019).
        </p>

        <p>
            This makes it clear that the techniques
            of individualization of power do exist in both
            environments, the family and the educational one and
            achieve their mission of generating differences and
            creating particular cases and in many cases labels.
            The work at school is done in a group and there is
            a range of comparison, in the discourse the teachers
            express themselves about the children in a general way, “they sleep”, “come on, relieve themselves,
            wash their faces” , “The children go out”, “the speed
            with which the children work”; it is noted that their
            verbalizations are made in the plural to the extent
            that the whole group must function in the same way.
        </p>

        <p>
            As Foucault (2003) affirms, it is in the school
            where concepts such as morality, sexuality, the
            norm, evaluation, among others, are not discussed,
            they are sustained in a passing from generation to
            generation and if what the philosopher affirms is
            related poststructuralist with the experience of early
            childhood children in school, it is well known that
            the implementation of technologies of disciplinary
            power by the teachers and sustained by the parents
            in the homes will continue with the formation of the
            subject in favor of the maintenance of power from
            the discipline.
        </p>

        <p>
            So far, the analysis has made it possible to
            observe that both at school and in the family, children
            are immersed in hierarchical power relationships that
            depend on the execution of disciplinary strategies,
            which would mean that all children are submissive
            and respond favorably to the intentions that their
            two environments in relation determine for them.
            Foucault explains that, for a power relationship to
            exist, the subject must be free, therefore, children
            in a condition of submission would not have a logic
            from the author's approaches, that is why the term
            of resistance is now involved at this time of the
            discussion.
        </p>

        <p>
            Resistance is not taken merely as the property of
            reacting or opposing a force in the opposite direction
            and similar to the action of the other, resistance is
            an active process, which sets a pattern of acting
            differently but still does not get out of power.
            An example of this is the dynamics of children
            responding to activities that are to their least liking
            where, even knowing that their teacher may refuse
            to change the activity, they suggest another more
            attractive activity for them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another example of such resistance is the
            negotiation that children make at the time of sleep,
            as this becomes a habit that must be followed. When
            a boy or girl does not want to sleep, they are urged to
            try, even so, this is not their will and even if they are
            lying on the mat they do not yield to the pressure of
            the group. Tantrums can also be interpreted as acts
            of resistance, which in some cases by generational
            tradition uses physical punishment to eliminate
            them. But, there are other ways of seeing the acts that
            children perform and that can not only be resistance,
            they can also be ways of controlling and executing
            the power of domination over their parents and
            caregivers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, the taking or the change in the condition
            of execution of power does not imply that the child
            “commands” more or that the adult “commands”
            less, no, this means that power relations can be
            altered and modified, since be it one way or another,
            without implying convenience for whom or which.
            Consequently, it is essential to begin to identify
            knowledge within parenting practices. Knowledge
            supposes the historical construction by which
            practices are configured, thus, for the purposes of this
            analysis, it is required to know where the practices
            are maintained in terms of historical dimension
            (Foucault, 2009).
        </p>

        <p>
            These are part of what the mothers expose and
            can be interpreted as the knowledge that sustains
            the practices, a whole series of justifications that
            emerge from the current context. The current state
            policy on early childhood indicates that this is the
            vital stage of the development cycle and that by
            guaranteeing integral development in it, favorable
            conditions are determined for the human being in
            the future (Restrepo-Segura, & García-Peña, 2021;
            Aguilar Barreto et al., 2019). It is probable that the
            mothers' knowledge is permeated by the condition
            set forth above, generating meanings and discourses
            that support the importance of their practices from
            special care in children, easy adaptation to change
            and guaranteeing a better future.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are many possible justifications that are
            the product of the historical and social construction
            that support its use by mothers with their children.
            Constructions such as that children need to be formed
            because they do not have a structure and because
            that is the function of parents, as is also evidenced by
            Ariés (1986), in their research on childhood through
            history. The teachers have a repertoire of knowledge
            more oriented to the demands of the environment
            and the guarantee of rights, it can be taken as an
            institutionalized knowledge since its passage through
            academic institutions and its constant relationship
            with state policies in favor of early childhood.
        </p>

        <p>
            Parenting practices do not go unnoticed in the
            production and maintenance of power and within their
            teachings, family and school teach children how the
            world works. It would then be expected that school
            and family in this particular context were oriented in
            different ways, but both are in charge of executing
            behavior regulation devices and introducing children
            to rules, norms and conditions, establishing in their
            head the "social order" (Foucault, 2009).
        </p>

        <p>
            Mothers insist that their children comply
            with the habits of hygiene, feeding and rest, that
            they maintain organization and order and avoid
            unwanted behaviors that go against the norm, which
            is ultimately part of the regulation of behavior. The
            teachers in the space of 8 hours and with the help of
            other institutional caregivers make the children carry
            out the actions that are requested, they are aware of
            the movements of each child in their group and have
            control over their body and their activities, In this
            way, it is the teacher who authorizes whether the
            child can go to the bathroom, what time they will
            eat, and when they can wash their hands and teeth.
            And although regulation devices at home seem less
            than at school, those implemented at home can be
            more drastic than those at school.
        </p>

        <p>
            The foregoing is subject to the verbalizations
            of the participants, taking into account that actions
            of physical punishment are considered a form of
            behavior regulation, which the teachers do not execute because the law specifically stipulates that a
            teacher cannot use any type of punishment that It is
            detrimental to the self-esteem of their students, but
            this is not something that is stipulated for parents,
            although the law states that a child should not be
            physically punished, it is still sustained in the speech
            of the people that it can be used hitting or screaming
            if the child's performance warrants it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The regulatory device that derives from physical
            punishment generates fear and this affects the way
            in which children construct themselves as subjects
            and appropriate the world, thus condemning that
            they also perpetuate the punishment and sustain it
            as suitable for training. Attached to the foregoing,
            regulatory devices such as controlling activities also
            have an inappropriate impact, since at school the
            activities that are controlled are academic and are
            assumed to be an integral development objective.
            On the contrary, at home, parental control activities
            impose them without careful thought and are
            sometimes routine, they even become activities that
            have no value for their cognitive, physical, or social
            development, among them is the use of television
            so that the child does not make noise, assigning
            tasks without performing preparation exercises
            beforehand, playing video or computer games to
            focus the child's attention and minimize their activity.
        </p>

        <p>
            These control devices are given life by the
            devices of truth, those that are knowledge in the
            strict sense of the discourse, it is not made up of
            several historical annexes, but rather accounts for
            the elaboration that the adult has made about their
            participation in the maintenance of power and in the
            modes of subjectivation (Foucault, 2003). The adults
            of the children participating in the study managed
            to incorporate discourses of social circulation and
            finally created their own perception of acting with
            respect to parenting.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thus, they provided the real reasons for their
            behavior as caregivers and among them are that their
            parenting practices are relevant because it implies
            maintaining a positive relationship with their sons and daughters, because by training them with respect
            to their practices their children will not pass for the
            same difficulties as them. Parents also consider as a
            mode of subjectivation that they have experience in
            the formation of their children and that by forming
            them through habits and rules in this way they will be
            well educated; they also include plans, summarizing
            that the successful development of children depends
            on learning what parents teach them as children
            learning to fend for themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
            The teachers establish as truth devices that
            favor their process of subjectivation with respect to
            operators of parenting practices in their students, the
            following: the child to the extent that he acquires
            the manners and habits that adapt easily to society,
            becomes he will become a person responsible for
            himself, he will respond favorably to the environment;
            in the same way, they state that children as subjects
            under construction must be in constant evolution and
            that their significant adults are there to help them in
            the process of becoming fit citizens of society.

        <p>
            The excess of control in the school and the
            family, the cases of flexibility in the family in response
            to the actions of resistance and the concern of the
            school as an institution to promote its ideologies in
            this case in accordance with the laws of the state
            for the former childhood, have created a relational
            triad school - family - childhood, where they do
            not operate separately, they are allied to achieve
            individual and group discourses, they are in constant
            communication, permeating and also modifying,
            because teachers as subjects influence children and
            They influence parents, children influence parents
            and their teachers, and parents influence their
            children and teachers as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            Foucault (2009) defines the institution as a
            place where power is executed through discipline,
            order is maintained and children and young
            people are prepared for coexistence, thus being
            the phenomenon of first-class children. childhood
            in the school context and the relational triad that
            is generated begins to direct the family also as an institution, which maintains power, exercises the
            same power, and reproduces it constantly.
        </p>

        <p>
            A second interest of this research, after
            power relations, is to account for the existence of
            technologies of the self, defined by Foucault (2005)
            as the techniques that allow individuals to carry
            out operations on their own bodies, souls, thoughts
            and behaviors and this in a way that achieves the
            transformation of himself until reaching a state of
            happiness. According to Foucault, technologies
            are also made up of practices, which is why
            the verbalizations provided by children will be
            contrasted to identify the configuration of their selfcare practices with Foucault's conceptualization.
        </p>

        <p>
            At first it is necessary to identify if the children
            carry out self-care practices and of what kind. The
            findings suggest that children carry out practices that
            are considered proper of self-care, despite this, they
            do not have sufficient evidence of being their own
            products or evidence that they are not reinforced by
            parents and teachers and when they stop reinforcing
            these are lost from the behavioral repertoire.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even so, an attempt is made to give a complete
            vision, since the technologies of whether they are not
            independent actions, they are dimensioned actions
            that require other executions. In the first moment
            of the classification based on Foucault's theoretical
            support, we will talk about those practices in children
            that account for their ability to evaluate themselves.
            In the presentation of the comics, the children
            showed the capacity for self-reflection oriented to
            aspects close to the domain of the body, that is, body
            postures, punishments, non-verbal expressions of
            affection, spatial location, which can be interpreted
            as a derivation of the relationship disciplinary power
            to which they are mediated, this implies that they are
            recognized as a subject body. However, the children,
            identified the concern and the ability to think within
            the comic, which implies that its construction of the
            mind subject can be facilitated and explored.
        </p>

        <p>
            Continuing with another type of practice, there
            is the execution of norms and habits; children, due
            to the two contexts in which they are involved and
            the power relations between these contexts, flow
            in an endless amount of demands, therefore, they
            recognize the existence of norms so that the world
            has an order. Children respect these norms, the more
            they recognize that these norms are external and not
            their own and await the approval and confirmation
            of the adult to carry them out; they also recognize
            that breaking a standard has consequences and this
            gives a notion of knowledge of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            Practices oriented to the ability to face the
            world and be independent in children are limited;
            children suggest the need for an adult to be able to
            survive in the world, however, in the presence of
            adults, children little by little in their development
            are acquiring skills that make them feel independent
            and their own. In this way, the capacity for selfgovernment is also affected, since if the child does
            not recognize the ability to face the world, they will
            not identify options to critically decide and influence
            their reality. Among the findings, it was evidenced
            that children recognize the power of long-term
            decisions, but still do not measure the effects of their
            actions at any other level.
        </p>

        <p>
            Foucault clearly states that whoever cares for
            himself must seek a state of health (Foucault, 2005).
            Children in relation to the care of their body have
            the behavioral repertoire that their adults - parents
            and teachers - have exercised and recognize habits
            of hygiene, grooming, the importance of physical
            activity, food, among others. This is an encouraging
            principle for the time to inquire about self-practices,
            being that, if children value their body and healthy
            physical state, they will have the basis to continue with
            the development of thought for the benefit of their
            life and achieve coherent modes of subjectivation.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the other hand, you cannot pretend that you
            take care of yourself, when you forget the other
            (Foucault, 2005). The other, for the children of the
            institution, not only translates into other children, they register as part of those others, their parents,
            teachers and other adults, not only their peers and
            companions, they even recognize those children
            as existing subjects with whom they do not share
            physical space and see each other for a few minutes
            a day. Children interpret the suffering in others and
            feel empathy for them, give help and let their adults
            know if they do not have the solution. However, they
            hit, hurt and offend their peers, but this makes sense
            in the power relations that they also exercise within
            their group and seek to adapt in the best way to their
            immediate environment.
        </p>

        <p>
            When inquiring about self-care practices in
            children of the institution, a series of actions appear
            vaguely that can be associated as such, however,
            although they are intended to improve the situation
            of children, these are still the result of the influence
            of disciplining technologies in the relational triad
            of power from the family and the initial education
            institution. These are altered as significant adults
            establish their usefulness and benefit in the lives of
            children.
        </p>

        <p>
            In summary, it is the adult who structures said
            practices from their knowledge, but these cannot yet
            be established as technologies of the self in the strict
            sense of the concept, since they do not contain the
            main component, that is, that they are developed and
            executed with will. own from the life expectancies
            that the subject presents. Despite the above, the
            fact that although in the early years, these actions
            cannot be interpreted as technologies of the self,
            does not mean that these are not being configured
            in the subject, it is likely that the construction of
            technologies of the self is also It is influenced by
            cognitive and physical development, which can
            show another type of development in the following
            stages of the life cycle (García et al., 2020).

        <!-- Conclusiones -->
        <hr>

        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
        <p>
            Currently, adult caregivers of children, to
            guarantee an integral development as defined by
            the national policies for childhood and adolescence, carry out a number of training practices that remain in
            coherence with what is established at a sociocultural
            level on what is expected to be achieved in the
            first stage of the life cycle and how appropriate
            development affects the rest of their lives. With
            respect to the above, parents within the family
            context carry out daily actions aimed at training,
            the most common being the interest in generating
            healthy grooming and hygiene habits, eating habits,
            schoolwork habits and the regulation of behavior.
        </p>

        <p>
            Parents in their concern to ensure the well-being
            of their children, from the first years incorporate
            a second training entity where initial education is
            practiced. This is known as Comprehensive Early
            Childhood Care based on the legal framework of Law
            1098 of 2006, Code of childhood and adolescence.
            These spaces work on the basis of early childhood
            in relation to the guarantees of rights and integral
            development. The conditions of these programs are
            clear, raising their interest in three basic aspects in
            children, nutrition, protection, and education. From
            the previous proof, variants of actions are also
            carried out so that children are formed from their
            institutional ideals.
        </p>

        <p>
            By analyzing in detail the parenting practices
            in both environments, educational and family, they
            respond to disciplinary actions based on the norm
            and control of behavior. Parents and educational
            agents are involved to ensure that their children and
            students stay within the norm since when they learn
            it from a young age, their interaction with the world
            and their reality will be more adaptive. However,
            children, whether in the capacity of children or
            students, initiate behaviors of resistance to this
            discipline, seeking other forms of relationship with
            their authority figures.
        </p>

        <p>
            The discourses that maintain current practices
            are the product of the socio-historical construction
            of adults and their individual relationship with
            the real context. Thus, control behaviors such as
            physical punishment are still maintained, even
            when child protection policies seek to eliminate this corrective model, employing others that increase
            self-reflection, promoting self-esteem and positive
            family relationships. The persistent thought in adults
            is that their children need to be trained, they require
            a structure, they demand guidance and their position
            as parents and teachers is to be regulators of said
            structure to guarantee the well-being of children and
            a better future.
        </p>

        <p>
            The involvement of the school in the first years
            of life, has modified the participation of parents as
            training agents through power relations; The school
            also functions as a regulator of parents' actions to
            guarantee comprehensive development. The school
            is based on academic principles and knowledge
            related to the legal aspect as part of its speeches
            and truth devices. The early childhood school as an
            institution promotes disciplinary actions in relation
            to the academic and political approaches of today's
            society, hence, its discursive position in the evolution
            of the life cycle, the guarantee of rights, peaceful
            coexistence, the common good, among others.
        </p>

        <p>
            The excess of control in the family and
            educational context has generated double-link
            relationships with feedback in three senses, which
            has been interpreted in this research as a relational
            triad where School - Family - Childhood are
            constructed as particular objects and are configured
            and they influence each other. In this way, not only
            the school, for boys and girls, fulfills a function as an
            institution, but the family begins to become visible
            as an institution, defined in Foucault's terms, which
            in relation to the relational triad helps maintain
            power, exercises the same power and reproduces it
            constantly.
        </p>

        <p>
            The power relations generated from school
            and family, account for a subject prepared to follow
            orders, commit to authority and set aside selfinterest to become a “we”, this is due to the fact that
            children in school They are not executing processes
            of construction of themselves from their positions
            and reality, since their reality is configured by adults
            as shared. Based on this, children in early childhood
            must have the spaces to doubt themselves and their environment, criticize them and actively participate
            in their world and their relationships, to leave behind
            the position of a submissive childhood that only
            receives and does not is able to give in return and
            transform.
        </p>

        <p>
            One aspect that can facilitate the bonding of
            early childhood children in the construction of
            subjectivity and the transformation of reality are the
            technologies of the self. Self-care practices are part
            of actions that can be highlighted as technologies of
            the self, but in children the behaviors that suggest
            self-care are derived from an entire disposition to the
            external agent, that is, it is subject to the teaching
            they provide their adults. Self-care practices in early
            childhood children exist, but they do not have the
            relational maturation essential to be considered
            technologies of the self. Now, with the fact that
            actions in favor of caring for oneself and the other
            are made visible, in future tense the infant will be
            open to the configuration of aspects that promote the
            development of technologies of the self.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, it is in the interest of the authors to
            suggest research that accounts for power relations
            in children after completing the initial education
            stage in early childhood and is immersed in another
            environment: formal education, which supports
            other interests, powers and meanings. Likewise, it
            is interesting to be able to apply strategies that favor
            the technologies of the self from the first years and
            from initial education, with this the guarantee of the
            quality of life in the next stages of the life cycle to be
            established with certainty
