                <hr class="hr-resumen">
                <p class="texto-resumen"> <b>Objective:</b> To describe care competence and its association with
                    overburden of caregivers
                    of patients with chronic diseases. <b>Method:</b> Quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional study,
                    with a convenience sample. Three instruments were used for data collection: the GCPC-UN
                    instrument for caregiver-patient characterization, the Homecare Skills Questionnaire (CUIDAR, as per
                    its name in Spanish), and the Zarit Burden Interview. Participants in this study
                    were 102 caregivers of people hospitalized in a health institution who met the inclusion criteria.
                    <b>Results:</b> Caregivers were mainly women, had a low level of education, high burden
                    (56.8%), and high level of care competence (68.6%). A statistically significant correlation
                    was found between overburden and overall scores on the CUIDAR instrument, as well as
                    with the following categories: knowledge, uniqueness and anticipation. <b>Conclusion:</b> Homecare
                    competence is associated with overburden of caregivers of people with CNCDs. Therefore, nursing
                    teams have to identify the needs of caregivers and take action so as to contribute
                    to seamless transitions to patients’ homes.

        <p class="titulo"> Introduction</p>

        <p>
            On a global scale, chronic non-communicable diseases
            (CNCDs) led to the death of 41 million people in 2016,
            which represents 71% of total deaths (1). CNCDs are
            mainly associated with risk factors such as unhealthy
            diets, use of alcohol and tobacco, air pollution, and
            sedentariness (2-3). This group of diseases includes
            cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, respiratory
            diseases, and mental diseases (3). They can lead to dependence and need for support in daily life (4),
            requiring the assistance of informal caregivers (5), who can
            be family members or friends, paid or not, who are in
            charge of providing support for carrying out daily tasks
            to people who have experienced changes in their physical and/or mental health (6).
        </p>

        <p>
            It is acknowledged that care of people with CNCDs is
            taken on by caregivers and family members, and these interactions may result in stress, due to the health
            conditions and the behavior of the people with these
            diseases. This situation faced by caregivers can result
            in overburden and feelings of impotence due to not
            knowing what to do or whom to ask for help, making
            that taking care of a ill person becomes an exhausting
            labor and a depressing process (7).
        </p>

        <p>
            The burden of uninterrupted care associates with anxiety and depression in caregivers affecting their life
            quality (8).
        </p>

        <p>
            For this reason, it is important that caregivers be prepared to develop their abilities and skills, so they
            are able
            to take on homecare (9). The Homecare Competence
            questionnaire (CUIDAR), as for the acronym in spanish) includes the following dimensions: knowledge,
            related to concepts about diseases, their treatment, and
            daily care; uniqueness, related to personal qualities that
            contribute to being able to face and overcome issues
            and challenges; instrumental and procedural, related
            to the skills and abilities to carry out care tasks and
            meet basic needs; enjoyment, referring to the extent of
            well-being and personal satisfaction related to perceived quality of life; anticipation, referring to
            foreseeing the needs of caregivers and identifying risks; and
            relationships and social interaction, referring to social
            relationships and support networks that improve the
            task of providing care. Adequate levels of these factors
            help caregivers achieve balance in their daily lives, and
            helps in meeting the needs of both caregivers and the
            patients (10), making it easy to provide care and reducing stress, since these roles and responsibilities
            can
            result in overburden for caregivers when they do not
            have the needed skills and knowledge(11).
        </p>

        <p>
            In a literature review, we found studies that address
            the issue of overburden of caregivers and their quality of life (12-15) but few address overburden of
            caregivers and homecare competence (16). Given this
            background, it is important to assess homecare skills
            before hospital discharge in order to be aware of the
            needs of patients with CNCDs and guide care plans and
            their follow-up (17), and by doing so, reduce the risk
            of overburden. A situation that demonstrates the gap in knowledge of the impact in competence of caring and
            the overburden in caregivers which is a relevant aspect
            to generate strategies that contributes to improving the
            security of the people with CNCD during hospitalization and discharge
        </p>

        <p>
            For these reasons, the objective of this study was to
            describe homecare competence and overburden among
            caregivers of people with CNCDs that are hospitalized.
        </p>

        <p class="titulo">Materials and Methods</p>

        <p>
            Quantitative, descriptive, correlation and cross-sectional study. A convenience sample was used. Caregivers
            of patients with CNCDs in hospital services were selected from the Internal Medicine department of a
            high-complexity public hospital. The inclusion criteria
            were being 18 years old or older; having been the main
            caregiver for more than three months; and having provided care for more than three hours a day. The sample
            was shaped of a hundred and two caregivers which
            constituted the quantity of population who were hospitalized during the time of data collection, they were
            informed of the objectives and procedures to be carried
            out, before signing free and informed consent was forms.
        </p>

        <p>
            Data collection was carried out in the institution by the
            researchers and by trained research assistants, during
            day and night shifts, as well as on weekends. The collection process was carried out between June and
            September 2019, in compliance with the inclusion criteria.
            All caregivers who were contacted agreed to participate in the survey
        </p>

        <p>
            The instruments used were:
        </p>

        <p>
            The GCPC-UN caregiver-patient characterization survey (18), with 42 items that survey the pair in three
            categories: overall conditions and sociodemographic
            profile; burden and perception of support; and available
            means of information and communication. The instrument’s use was authorized by the research group on the
            care of chronic patients (GCPC) at the Nursing School
            of Universidad Nacional de Colombia (UN).
        </p>

        <p>
            The homecare skills questionnaire - caregiver, short
            version, with 20 likert-type items, with the following
            response possibilities: hardly ever or never; sometimes; often; and almost always or always; with a scale
            from 0 to 3. Scores are defined as follows: knowledge
            (low 0-3, average 4-6, high 7-9), uniqueness (low 0-6,
            average 7-9, high 10-12), instrumental and procedural
            (low 0-3, average 4-6, high 7-9), enjoyment (low 0-6,
            average 7-9, high 10-12), anticipation (low 0-2, average 3-4, high 5-6); relationships and social
            interaction,
            (low 0-6, average 7-9, high 10-12); and the overall score (low 0-36, average 37-48, high 49-60). The
            instrument has a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.928 (9). The instrument was used with the authorization of the GCPC.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Zarit burden interview (8), composed of 22 Likert-type items with five response options: 1 means
            never, and 5 means almost always. A score of under
            46 means no overburden, from 46 to 56, mild overburden, and over 56, severe overburden. The instrument
            is valid and suitable for Colombia, with a Cronbach’s
            alpha of 0.86 (19). The instrument was used with the
            authorization of the provider, the Mapi Research Trust.
        </p>

        <p>
            Data were entered on a Microsoft excel ® 2019
            spreadsheet and processed in SPSS ® statistics software version 23. Univariate descriptive analysis was
            carried out. Qualitative variables were described using
            frequency tables, and quantitative variables were described by central tendency measures (mean, median),
            dispersion measures (standard deviation), and position measures (minimum, maximum, range). Bivariate
            analysis was performed using the Kruskal Wallis test,
            and correlation analysis with the Spearman’s method.
            We considered differences as statistically significant
            when p &#60; 0.05.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Ethical aspects</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            The study was approved by the research ethics committee of Hospital Hernando Moncaleano Perdomo, minutes
            number 001-003 of 2019, considering the following
            bioethical principles: respect of human dignity, privacy, freedom of speech and feelings, confidentiality,
            and
            reciprocity.
        </p>

        <p class="titulo">Results</p>

        <p>
            One hundred and two caregivers of CNCD patients
            participated in the study, of whom 74.5% were women, 66.7% were between 36 and 59 years old, with
            an average of 48.2 years (SD±14.9), 43.1% had completed primary school, 53.9% worked in the household,
            90.2% had low economic status, and 73.5% had a spouse (Table 1).
        </p>

        <p>
            Their relationship with the patient with CNCD was parent-child or spouse (38.2% and 37.3%, respectively).
            20.5% of caregivers reported that they had a CNCD.
            87% had been committed to care since diagnosis, 67.7% had been the sole caregivers for more than 37 months
            (49%) and more than 20 hours a day (60.8%). Patients
            cared for were 60 years old or older (72.5%), with high
            levels of dependence (52.9%) and no intellectual alterations (61.8%), and they saw themselves as a light or
            moderate burden (43.13% and 36.3% respectively).

        </p>

        <p>
            Regarding the overall scores on the CUIDAR instrument, caregivers who did not experience overburden
            had high scores, as opposed to caregivers who experienced mild overburden and had low or average scores.
        </p>

        <p class="titulo">Discussion</p>

        <p>
            Care is directly associated with the family environment, where caregivers are usually spouses or children,
            and are mostly women, women are assigned care tasks, and make up an unpaid workforce, as shown in the
            literature (10,14,20-26). Women are asigned to care
            labors, to being in an informal laboral which is not
            remunerated based on cultural and social representations (27). This is a key factor for understanding
            current gender inequalities associated with care of adult
            individuals with CNCDs (28), for which it is necessary
            to implement measures to increase equality in the care
            of people with chronic conditions. The majority of the
            surveyed caregivers had spouses, worked in the household, had been committed to care since diagnosis as
            sole caregivers, had low economic status, and had completed primary school. These findings are in line with
            those of previous studies (21,23,29).
        </p>

        <p>
            This study found that six out of ten caregivers experienced overburden, while other studies have reported
            overburden in four out of ten (21), or one-third with
            intense overburden (22). Overburden can be associated with taking on responsibility for treatment, as well
            as emotional and practical support tasks, decision-making, and health services paperwork (30), all of which
            are situations that lead to stress, are described as a burden, and affect the quality of life of caregivers
            in its
            social, personal and economic aspects (31).
        </p>

        <p>
            The findings of this study allow us to conclude that
            there is a correlation between homecare skills and
            overburden. Likewise, they describe a correlation between the knowledge dimension and overburden. It is
            important to recognize that the caregiver does his own
            functions in solitude with low knowledge of them and
            without a familiar or healthcare system support leading
            to a physical tension and a great emotional burden, putting them at risk of becoming sick (32-34). During
            this
            process caregivers go through three stages: the first is
            intense, when they prepare to become a caregiver; in
            the second, they learn the routine and adapt to changes; and in the third, they feel they are competent to
            perform their duties, finding a purpose for their work
            and self-care (28). and improving their skills over time
            (11). Lack of appropriate communication about how
            to deal with these diseases results in lack of preparation
            to take on care, which leads to stress and overburden
            (35-36).
        </p>

        <p>
            Moreover, a correlation was found between the uniqueness dimension and overburden. The acceptance
            and organization of the role of caregiver creates interdependence in the pair. Caregivers are aware that
            they
            live to take care of patients, who are now part of their
            lives, and they complement each other. This strong
            bond between caregivers and patients with CNCDs is
            “special,” and when the care process takes place, leads
            to new roles and improved provision of care, as well
            as personal growth for the pair (37). Uniqueness can
            be a protective factor that allows them to overcome
            their problems as caregivers, resulting in reduced risk
            of overburden.
        </p>

        <p>
            The results also show a correlation between the anticipation dimension and overburden, in which higher
            scores mean lower risk of experiencing overburden. Not
            being able to anticipate unexpected events results in a
            high percentage of caregivers who experience mild or
            intense levels of overburden.
        </p>

        <p>
            Being supported by healthcare staff helps them define
            priorities, solve problems, and make decisions. Being
            informed increases confidence, even though the provision of care is complex due to the number of daily tasks
            to be performed, many of which cannot be anticipated
            (11). When caregivers are aware, they can anticipate
            care demands and prevent overburden.
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore, when nursing teams assesses homecare
            skills by means of the CUIDAR instrument before hospital discharge, they can anticipate needs, and together
            with caregivers, they can plan and define care strategies that strengthen the caregivers’ role, with the aim
            of
            providing continuity of safe and high-quality care, with
            fewer readmissions and better outcomes.

        <p class="titulo">Conclusion</p>

        <ul class="lista">
            <li>There was prevalence of women, the type of kinship was mostly spouses or children, most had low
                levels of education, were committed to care for
                long periods, and had low socioeconomic status.
                Mild or intense overburden was observed as a result of taking on the role of caregiver, and this can
                have a negative impact on quality of life.</li>
            <li>As for homecare skills, the knowledge, uniqueness,
                and anticipation dimensions had statistically significant correlations with overburden of caregivers.
                Therefore, it is important that nurses identify needs
                of caregivers during hospitalization relative in order to design care strategies to diminish the
                negative impact that disease and hospitalization bring
                along.</li>
            <li>Therefore, it is important to assess homecare before
                it is provided in order to implement a strategy that
                reduces the risk of overburden and prepares caregivers of patients with CNCDs to face the changes
                that are inherent to their role.</li>
            <li>Healthcare staff, especially nursing professionals,
                must implement support programs for caregivers
                aimed at preventing overburden and improving
                their homecare skills, which will have a positive
                effect on the quality of life of both caregivers and
                patients.</li>
