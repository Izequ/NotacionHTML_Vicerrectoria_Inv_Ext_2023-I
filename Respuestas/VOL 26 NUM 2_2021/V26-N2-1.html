                        Monitoring the flow of sewerage systems allows us to know the real behavior of each system and
                        serves as a fundamental tool in wastewater management. For the design of sewerage systems, it is
                        necessary to know the wastewater flows that will be transported by the system and, based on
                        these
                        volumes, the factors that represent the consumption patterns and the characteristics of each
                        community must be estimated. In the absence of information, these factors should be estimated
                        with
                        existing empirical equations developed in research carried out in different cities around the
                        world.
                        The main objective of this research is to estimate the factors specific to the sanitary sewerage
                        system of San José de Cúcuta, for this purpose, the monitoring of the wastewater flow was
                        implemented for 19 weeks, and upon analyzing the data, the hourly variation of the flow entering
                        the
                        system was obtained, and based on the measured flows, a major factor was determined, which
                        represents the characteristics of the city; The factor obtained was also compared with the
                        results
                        of the existing empirical equations and it was possible to identify which of these equations
                        best
                        fit the monitoring campaigns.

                        La monitorización de los caudales de los sistemas de alcantarillado permite conocer el
                        comportamiento real de cada sistema y sirve como herramienta esencial en la gestión de las aguas
                        residuales. Para el diseño de los sistemas de alcantarillado es necesario conocer los caudales
                        de
                        aguas residuales que serán transportados por el sistema y, a partir de estos volúmenes, se deben
                        estimar los factores que representan los patrones de consumo y las características de cada
                        comunidad. A falta de información, estos factores deben estimarse con las ecuaciones empíricas
                        existentes desarrollada en investigaciones realizadas en diferentes ciudades del mundo. El
                        objetivo
                        principal de esta investigación es estimar los factores inherentes al sistema de alcantarillado
                        sanitario de San José de Cúcuta. Para ello se implementó el monitoreo del caudal de aguas
                        residuales
                        durante 19 semanas, y al analizar los datos se obtuvo la variación horaria del caudal que
                        ingresa al
                        sistema, y con base en los caudales medidos se determinó un factor mayor que representa las
                        características de la ciudad; el factor obtenido también se comparó con los resultados de las
                        ecuaciones empíricas existentes y se logró identificar cuál de estas ecuaciones se ajusta mejor
                        a
                        las campañas de monitoreo.

            <p>
                The planning and development of cities must consider as a fundamental part, the existing urban
                infrastructure and the engineering works planned for the future, in this field play a very important
                role
                sanitation networks and urban drainage systems <a href="#r1">[1]</a>, which must be built for an
                established design period and
                for which the expected future flows must be projected <a href="#r2">[2]</a>; as well as, its efficient
                operation, thanks to
                different factors; such as budgeting adequate maintenance <a href="#r3">[3]</a>. The projected flows for
                a region or city have
                a direct relationship with the variation of the climate, the socioeconomic condition, the number of
                inhabitants and the habits of life, work and consumption <a href="#r4">[4]</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The proper design of sewerage systems depends on the correct estimation of the magnitude of expected
                flows
                in the network and unexpected or poorly projected variation in the range of expected flows can affect
                the
                hydraulic performance of some components of sanitation systems, for example, sewage pumping stations,
                final
                discharge outfalls and wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), which are designed with the maximum and
                minimum
                flows of the system <a href="#r5">[5]</a>, <a href="#r6">[6]</a>. The appropriate way to estimate the
                expected wastewater flows is by using
                information from consumption patterns and existing wastewater monitoring campaigns in each city or
                community
                <a href="#r1">[1]</a>, previously carried out at different points of the network. In addition, in which
                information is
                available on the hourly variation of the flow, real magnitude of domestic, industrial, commercial and
                institutional wastewater flows. Also, the factors that represent the characteristics of each system: the
                return coefficient and the flow increase factor <a href="#r2">[2]</a>, <a href="#r7">[7]</a>. The
                reliability of wastewater flow estimates
                depends on these factors <a href="#r8">[8]</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the absence of this information, the flow variation and the factors of the system to be designed must
                be
                estimated with existing empirical equations, which are the product of research conducted in other cities
                in
                the world and that generally differ have very different characteristics to the cities and populations of
                Colombia <a href="#r9">[9]</a>. These equations are the result of field measurements and engineering
                criteria and have as
                variables the number of inhabitants and the average daily flow of wastewater <a href="#r10">[10]</a>,
                also taking into account
                parameters recommended in books on wastewater engineering recognized in the academic world; but the
                parameters obtained do not adequately represent the behaviour of the system to be designed and can
                sometimes
                oversize the components of the drainage system, especially in small cities <a href="#r11">[11]</a>, <a
                    href="#r12">[12]</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                To measure the temporal and spatial variation of inflows into sewerage systems, several authors have
                established different methodologies and some of these allow integrating the variation of wastewater flow
                rate over time, with the variability of physical and chemical parameters that determine water quality
                for
                dry and wet climate conditions <a href="#r13">[13]</a>. The main objective of this article is to
                estimate the factors of the
                sanitary sewerage system of San José de Cúcuta, for this was implemented for 19 weeks and for 24 hours a
                day, monitoring the flow of wastewater and to perform the analysis of the data measured in the period of
                measurements, The hourly variation of the incoming flow to the system was obtained, as well as the
                maximum,
                average and minimum flows that are contributed to the drainage system, based on the measured flows, the
                increase factor that represents the characteristics of the city was determined; The factor obtained was
                also
                compared with the results calculated using the empirical equations existing in the underlying theory of
                sanitary sewer design, and it was possible to identify which of these equations best fitted the
                monitoring
                data measured in the monitoring campaigns.
            </p>

            <p class="titulo">Materials and methods
            </p>

            <p class="subtitulo"> Materials </p>

            <p>Wastewater flow monitoring was conducted for 19 weeks (136 days), from October 20, 2019 to March 3, 2020;
                a
                single flow measurement point was implemented, identifying a confluence location of a network of
                collectors
                of the sanitary sewer system. The network is bounded by topography and forms a natural catchment of the
                terrain that forms a closed network, whose drainage system converges to a final discharge point or final
                discharge collector.</p>

            <p>
                For the monitoring campaign an ultrasonic flow meter data logger reference LT-US Sofrel was used, with
                this
                meter data was obtained from the incoming flow to the system every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day. The
                measured
                data were stored in the internal memory of the device and then transmitted twice a day to a web server
                (MyWebScada), the specific times of data transmission to the server were previously programmed in the
                configuration of the equipment. The stored information could be viewed, managed and downloaded.
            </p>

            <p>
                Rainfall events affect the incoming flow to a sanitary sewer system. If there are erroneous connections,
                caused by clandestine storm sewer connections that discharge into the sanitary sewer network, there are
                increases in flow that exceed the hydraulic capacity of the projected collectors, generating overflows
                on
                the surface of the inspection chambers <a href="#r14">[14]</a>. The sanitary sewage system of San José
                Cúcuta is characterized
                by the existence of erroneous connections, mainly due to the absence of storm sewers in several sectors
                of
                the city; this, despite the fact that for several decades the city has presented multiple
                characteristics of
                a very dynamic conurbation <a href="#r15">[15]</a>; for this reason it was necessary to identify the
                days of dry weather during
                the monitoring campaign and with this the days in which rainfall events occurred were discarded.
            </p>

            <p>
                Two meteorological stations located in areas near the monitored sewage network were monitored. During
                the
                same monitoring period, the CAMILO DAZA AIRPORT station [16015010], categorized as main synoptic, and
                the
                FRANCISCO DE PAULA SANTANDER UNIVERSITY station [16015110] categorized as main climatic, both stations
                are
                operated by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies (IDEAM), were constantly
                consulted.
            </p>

            <p class="subtitulo">Study Area</p>

            <p>
                The study area is located in the city of San José Cúcuta, Colombia, with a total area of 170.58 hectares
                and
                in which communes 3 and 4 are located. The selection of the area was based on the characteristics of the
                existing sanitary sewerage network, due to the topology in the sector has a closed network with a single
                point of discharge, which greatly facilitates the monitoring of the flow of wastewater to be performed
                and
                additionally in the sector of analysis presents a uniform socioeconomic stratum, giving it a homogeneous
                characteristic as a study sample.
            </p>

            <p class="subtitulo">Maximum hourly flow rate and increase factor</p>

            <p>
                The data obtained in the monitoring campaign allows us to calculate the wastewater flow measured at each
                hour of the day, obtaining a total of twenty-four (24) flow data per day. For each day of data, the
                maximum
                hourly flow value (QMH), the average daily flow (Qmd) and with these two, the factor of increase (FP) is
                obtained; which takes into account the variations in water consumption by the population and represents

            <p>
                The monitoring of the meteorological stations near the study area identified that during the 136 days of
                monitoring, there were rainfall events on 36 days, therefore, 100 days of data recording were used,
                corresponding to the dry weather period. Graph 1 shows the total value of the aforementioned monitoring
                data, and in this graph some flow values can be identified that are greater than the range of average
                flow
                values obtained, these values are due to the 36 days of rainfall during the data collection period, the
                rain
                is reflected in increased flow in the sanitary sewerage networks due to the existence of erroneous
                connections that are reflected in increases or peaks in the flow transported by the collectors of the
                drainage system.
            </p>

            <p>
                Graph 2 shows the daily variation of the wastewater flow obtained at the analysis site during the time
                of
                investigation for the sanitary sewer analyzed. With the flow data recorded at the same time, for the 100
                days of dry weather, the hydrograph of inflows to the sanitary sewer was constructed and is shown in
                Graph 3
                <a href="#r20">[20]</a>. It was determined that the QMH recorded in the study area was 208.67 cubic
                meters per hour (m 3/h),
                value recorded at the 12th hour of the day and the Qmd was 181.33 m 3/h, in the same way the PF was
                calculated, which was 1.15.
            </p>

            <p>
                The empirical equations existing in the underlying theory of the maximum flow factor and its
                applicability
                to the sanitary sewerage system of San José de Cúcuta <a href="#r21">[21]</a> were evaluated, the
                initial comparison of the
                values of PF and Qmd obtained from the 100 days of monitoring, with the values obtained by implementing
                equations (1), (2), (3) and (4) was performed.
            </p>

            <p>
                To evaluate these equations were taken into account the different conditions of application and
                restriction
                of each of them, which are defined by their authors, these restrictions are due to the application
                ranges
                and units of the average daily flow of the equation.

                days of dry weather monitoring are shown in the table, because of the size of the data it is not

                It is observed in the results shown that, when using the empirical equations of PF of different authors
                in
                the design of sanitary sewers, very different values are obtained from those measured in the monitoring
                campaigns, as obtained by <a href="#r11">[11]</a>, <a href="#r22">[22]</a>, which are in a range of 1.11
                to 1.22. While the range of the results
                obtained with the equations evaluated ranges between 2.46 and 3.47. Evidencing that the results of the
                equations analyzed exceed by more than double the value obtained to the result of the PF measured in the
                field in the sanitary sewer.

            <!-- Conclusiones -->

            <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
            <p>
                The analysis of the data obtained in the dry weather monitoring campaign, allowed estimating the QMH
                recorded at
                12 hours of the day with a value of 208.67 m 3/h, it was also possible to calculate the Qmd which
                yielded a
                value of
                181.33 m 3/h. When calculating the relationship between QMH and Qmd, known as the PF for the city of San
                José
                de Cúcuta, a value of 1.15 was obtained; this value is lower than the range recommended by Colombian
                regulations,
                which is 1.4 to 3.8.
            </p>

            <p>
                When evaluating the Gaines Utah, Los Angeles and Tchobanoglous equations, currently used in the design
                of
                sewerage systems in Colombia, it was possible to establish that the results obtained show a behavior
                different from
                the measured values. It is demonstrated that none of the methodologies recommended in the underlying
                theory
                adjusts to the behavior of the incoming flows to the sanitary sewer analyzed and therefore it is
                necessary
                to continue
                implementing wastewater flow measurements in order to obtain the characteristics of the system.
            </p>

            <p>
                The range of the PFs measured in the monitoring of the sanitary sewer of Cúcuta was 1.11 to 1.22, while
                the
                range of
                the results of the equations evaluated was between 2.46 and 3.47, showing a percentage increase in the
                PFs
                obtained
                by equations that varied between 203% and 309% with respect to the monitored PFs. The existing
                difference
                could
                have a significant influence on the estimation of design flows, on the oversizing of the components of
                the
                drainage
                system and on the cost of implementing urban drainage projects.
