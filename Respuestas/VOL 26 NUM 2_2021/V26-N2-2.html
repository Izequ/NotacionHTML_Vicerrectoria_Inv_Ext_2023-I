                    Since the human being had the need to move from one place to another quickly and reliably, the
                    pavement is
                    created in order to facilitate the transport of people and goods, deriving various types of
                    structures with their
                    own characteristics. Rigid pavement, due to its properties, has a greater participation in road
                    construction
                    since it provides high resistance in bearing loads, greater durability and little maintenance.
                    Technological
                    development optimizes study, design, and construction processes by offering tools that include the
                    use of
                    finite elements, such as EverFe 2.26. This software allows to analyze of a rigid pavement structure
                    composed
                    of subgrade, granular subbase, and hydraulic concrete slabs, determining forces and deflections
                    caused by
                    friction factors, warping, and traffic loads; that, for the object and methodology of the study, two
                    types
                    of scenarios are formulated: 1. Analysis of design parameters for only one slab and 2. Analysis of
                    design
                    parameters for a set of slabs using segments and tie bars. The results given will be a point of
                    comparison
                    to determine maximum efforts and deflections in both scenarios, directly obtaining the justification
                    of the
                    important use of load transmission elements and the essentials of the application of finite elements
                    when
                    designing rigid pavement structures, since the behavior of the same is studied in depth obtaining
                    real results
                    of greater precision.

                    se crea el pavimento con la finalidad de facilitar el transporte de personas y mercancías,
                    derivándose varios tipos
                    de estructuras con características propias. El pavimento rígido por sus propiedades, tiene mayor
                    participación
                    en la construcción vial ya que proporciona alta resistencia en el soporte de cargas, mayor
                    durabilidad y
                    poco mantenimiento. El desarrollo tecnológico optimiza procesos de estudio, diseño y construcción

        <p>
            The finite eleme nt modeling of rigid pavement structures has become more important in recent years due to
            the high
            technological progress since it allows us to know more accurately the real behavior of a road structure
            under loading
            conditions and environmental effects <a href="#r1">[1]</a>. This method is based on the numerical analysis for the
            determination
            of stresses and deflections utilizing the discretization of the element connected through nodes and arcs,
            where the
            accuracy of the results is directly proportional to the size of the mesh with which it works; that is, the
            smaller the
            discretization or division of the element, the more accurate the results will be.
        </p>

        <p>
            EverFe is one of the software based on three-dimensional finite element models, developing its usefulness in
            the
            field of study and design of rigid pavements because it guarantees a more accurate approach in obtaining
            results of
            stresses and deflections in slabs <a href="#r2">[2]</a>, offering a wide range of analysis scenarios where you can take into
            account the
            longitudinal and transverse segments, joints, load spectra and modeling of one or more slabs <a href="#r3">[3]</a>; making it
            a more
            practical and complete method concerning analytical methodology software.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through EverFe 2.26, a rigid pavement structure is modeled corresponding to an urban road with hydraulic
            concrete
            slabs, sub-base support layer following INVIAS guidelines and subgrade. This structure is subjected to loads
            generated
            by vehicles and external factors of temperature changes that allow us to see the behavior of the structure
            against
            factors that cause stresses and deflections in the slabs. For this, two scenarios are applied: 1) Modeling a
            slab with
            a support layer and 2) Modeling a group of slabs where the presence of voussoirs and tie bars are present,
            looking
            together at the indispensable function that this type of reinforcement has in the pavement; since these
            elements are
            responsible for the load transmission and durability of the joint system, directly influencing the
            performance of rigid
            pavement, where if the transmission is inadequate, the slabs would be affected since the load capacity is
            reduced,
            directly causing structural damage to the pavement.
        </p>

        <p>
            By determining the factors that influence the behavior of the structure, it is intended to have a basic
            knowledge
            about the design procedure of rigid pavement, demonstrating whether the structure is suitable or not for the
            Ndesign
            calculated in the traffic study. In this way, it is shown in a summarized and concrete way the optimal
            methodology at
            the time of defining each one of the efforts and deformations, the treatment of the obtained information,
            the correct
            check of the slabs by criteria given by AASHTO and INVIAS, and the analysis of results; all applied to a
            real structure
            using the finite element modeling.

        <p class="subtitulo">Analysis of the finite element method</p>

        <p>
            As technology advances, this method has become more useful in the modeling of rigid pavement structures
            because it
            can accurately represent the field conditions of traffic loading and weathering. It is a method that is
            highly dependent
            on the mesh size or number of element divisions and boundary conditions. Previous research has defined that
            the
            optimum number of divisions should be 16*16*2 <a href="#r4">[4]</a> <a href="#r5">[5]</a>; however, this criterion is not universal since other
            studies
            have established a division of 32*32*3 according to the dimensions of the slab <a href="#r3">[3]</a>. It should be noted that
            the mesh
            used in this modeling is of equal size in each layer of the pavement structure, in addition to greatly
            affecting the
            accuracy of the results, i.e., having a smaller mesh the results will be more accurate. However, if the mesh
            is too small
            it leads to more time and computational work <a href="#r3">[3]</a>, so, for this article, several modeling was performed by
            varying the
            mesh width between 16 to 32, establishing that, to have good accuracy of the information in a short modeling
            time
            and low memory capacity, the meshing of 24*24 in the (x-y) plane and a subdivision in the z-plane of 3
            elements is
            applied.
        </p>

        <p>
            To have an overview of the meshing work, it is taken into account that the geometry of the model is
            rectangular, where
            EverFE handles a 20-node cube with rectilinear meshes for the upper layers and an 8-node rectangle for the
            subgrade
            as shown in Figure 1.
        </p>

        <div class="image">

        </div>

        <p>
            The finite elements use constitutive models (elastic, plastic, elastoplastic, viscoelastic, etc.) to
            determine the stresses,
            deformations, and deflections in a micromechanical way; that is to say, at a global level in fine, granular
            treated, and
            untreated materials. In the static analysis, the material properties must be taken into account, which is
            expressed in a
            stiffness matrix (K) and column vectors of displacements or unknowns (u') and external forces (F') that
            intervene in
            the problem domain. See equation 1.
        </p>

        <p class="ecuacion">[K]{u'} = {F'} (1)</p>

        <p>
            The implementation of this method is very useful since it generates color diagrams that offer a broader view
            of the
            stresses and deflections of the slab at the points of interest such as edge, corner, and interior of the
            slab, which can be
            divided according to their cause into transit, warping and friction stresses <a href="#r6">[6]</a><a href="#r7">[7]</a><a href="#r7">[7]</a><a href="#r8">[8]</a><a href="#r9">[9]</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Analysis of the empirical-mechanistic method</p>

        <p>
            This method was developed by Westergaard (1948) which considers a free slab applying a single wheel load
            with a
            circular contact area to determine the stresses and deflections at critical points of interest such as
            edges, corners, and
            interior of the slab. For each point of interest, there is a particular equation that allows knowing the
            stress states of
            the structure at the mentioned points; likewise, this method has the limitation that these results can only
            be known at
            a specific point, unlike the finite element method, which offers a global view of the behavior of the
            structure against
            external loads and the action of the weather. <a href="#r10">[10]</a><a href="#r11">[11]</a> <a href="#r12">[12]</a>.

        <p>
            The sum of stresses at each of the critical points can be broken down in equations 2, 3 and 4 as follows:

        <p class="subtitulo">Characterization of axles</p>

        <p>
            The traffic study is an indispensable requirement when designing a pavement structure, since it projects and
            determines
            the number of 8.2 ton equivalent axles that will pass through the roadway, constituting the -Ndesign,
            defining by
            classification, the traffic level with which the thickness of the slab is calculated using the INVIAS
            methodology <a href="#r13">[13]</a>.
            For this article, the structure is analyzed with real data from the traffic study provided by the Mayor's
            Office of
            Motavita-Boyacá, where for the paving project of 4th Street in hydraulic concrete, it shows average daily
            traffic -
            TPD of 656 vehicles. Following the INVIAS procedure <a href="#r13">[13]</a>, the design traffic-Ndesign corresponding to NT2 is
            calculated, where 8% belongs to commercial vehicles up to the classification of 3S3 (design vehicle).
        </p>

        <p>
            The number of tires and weight per axle for the design vehicle is determined according to the current
            resolution 4100
            of 2004, which regulates the type of vehicles, dimensions, maximum gross weight, and axle type of motor
            vehicles
            for land transport <a href="#r14">[14]</a>, as shown in Table I.

            For its respective modeling, Figure 3 shows a planning scheme where the information is given in Table I is
            graphically
            represented, where the separation of the axles in the X and Y direction is taken into account. To get
            results closer to
            reality, measurements of axle spacing and tire width are taken to determine the geometry of the load plate
            or contact
            area of each of the axles. In this way, it is possible to model them individually using the load spectrum
            methodology
            to determine the damage caused in the slab.

            For the modeling of axles, EverFe requires the definition of the geometry of the contact area between square
            and
            rectangular to consider each tire separately; in this way, the axle weight is distributed by the number of
            tires that
            compose it to know the load per tire that will be transmitted directly to the concrete slab. For the case
            study, a
            rectangular footprint is assumed and its dimensions are shown in Table II.

        <p>
            The pavement structure to be modeled is obtained with the INVIAS methodology <a href="#r13">[13]</a> from the following design
            parameters:
        </p>

        <ul class="lista">
            <li>Subgrade CBR of 5.5%, subgrade categorization S3. </li>
            <li>Granular sub-base layer according to the specifications of Article 320 of the INVIAS-2013 with a
                thickness of 25
                cm class B.</li>
            <li>Hydraulic concrete slab with a modulus of rupture of 40 kg/cm2
                .</li>
            <li>Ndiseño NT2 that a hydraulic concrete slab thickness of 21 cm with dimensions 320 cm wide and 250 cm
                long is
                obtained.</li>
            <li>Temperature gradient - ∆T. It indicates the temperature difference that the slab undergoes due to
                climatic changes
                causing differential contractions or movements throughout the slab <a href="#15r">[15]</a>. </li>
            <li>Modulus of reaction of the whole - Kefective. This is a determining factor in the design of a rigid
                pavement because
                it encompasses the reaction of the layers underlying the slab, including the subgrade. It is known that
                the slab cannot
                be placed directly on the foundation soil, due to several properties that affect it, so it requires
                overcoming this problem
                by utilizing the proportion of layers between the subgrade and the slab so that the stresses generated
                by traffic can be
                received and transmitted to the subgrade in a smaller proportion <a href="#r4">[4]</a>. </li>

        <p class="titulo">Results and Analysis</p>

        <p>
            When modeling the rigid pavement structure, the points to be evaluated (interior, edge, and corner) of the
            slab are
            defined by determining stresses in the X-Y direction and deflections at each of the analysis points. These
            results are
            defined by axis type in Table III.
        </p>

        <div class="image">

        <p>
            In addition to this, the frictional forces generated by uniform temperature changes (σf) must be determined.
            This is
            determined by equation 5:
        </p>

        <p class="ecuacion">σf=0.18*L [Kg/cm2] (5)</p>

        <p>Where: </p>

        <p>L = Length of the slab [m].</p>

        <p>
            The calculated value is 0.45 Kg/cm2
            , which is the same for all the evaluated points and for each type of modeled axis
            since it is only a function of the length of the slab.
        </p>

        <p>
            With <b>σf</b> calculated, a check of the corner, interior, and edge stresses are performed using equations
            2, 3,
            and 4,
            verifying that it complies with the design criteria. In the same way, a deflection check is performed where
            none of the
            obtained deflections is greater than 0.15 cm being this the maximum value for the failure of the concrete.

            In the same way, the forces and deflections for the slab are determined considering the segments and tie
            bars, as shown
            in Table VI.

        </div>

        <p>
            As can be seen in Tables IV, V, and VI, two types of modeling were carried out. In the first one, a slab
            without
            segments or tie bars was considered and in the second one, the set of slabs with their respective segments
            and tie
            bars were considered; to which the stresses and deflections produced by traffic loads, warping, and friction
            were
            determined. According to the above, it is observed in the first modeling that the service values of the
            structure are
            lower than the admissible ones, having a maximum consumption percentage of 70% for the stresses and 81.73%
            for
            the deflections. Both values were produced by the tandem axis and were located at the corner of the slab.
            The stresses
            of the tridem axis were below the stress states produced by the tandem axis due to the dimensions of the
            slab, since it
            was not possible to locate the 3 axes within the same element, forcing to place the load only of the first 2
            axes at the
            points of interest.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the second modeling, it was observed that the service values of the structure, considering the load
            transfer and
            tie bars, are lower than the admissible ones, obtaining a maximum consumption value of 97.75% for the forces
            and
            23.93% for the deflections. Unlike the first model, these percentages were obtained in different points, the
            maximum
            stresses were located in the corner of the most loaded slab and the deflections in the interior of the slab
            where both
            values were produced by the tandem axis.
        </p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V26-N2-2/img57.png" width="80%">
            <p><b>Figure 5. </b>Tandem axle stresses and deflections - scenario 1 and 2</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            In the two modeled scenarios, it could be observed that the tandem axis causes the highest stresses and
            deflections as
            shown in Figure V, which were located at the corner and inside the slab. It should be noted that in the
            second modeling
            the maximum deflection was obtained in the interior of the slab, which is improbable because at this point
            there is an
            adequate distribution of forces and deflections, deducing that the result is a consequence of the
            incorporation of the
            voussoirs and tie bars, which are responsible for transmitting the deflections to the attached slabs where
            the magnitude
            is greatly reduced at the edge and corner points. This decrease corresponds to 71.86% at the corner, 55.06%
            at the
            edge, and 12.86% inside the slab. In the second scenario, the stresses increased 28.35% at the edge, 6 % at
            the corner,
            and 9.30 % at the interior for the loaded slab and parallel to it.

        </div>

        <p>
            As can be seen in graph I, the stresses increase when the structure is modeled with segments, allowing to
            see the
            effective load transfer that this system generates in the slabs causing that the load-bearing work is done
            by the whole
            and not individually, observing that the most affected point is the corner having the highest magnitude of
            stresses.
        </p>

        <p>
            If the change in magnitude of the deflections in the two scenarios is analyzed, graph II shows that the load
            transmitting
            elements considerably benefit the slabs, since they allow them to suffer less in terms of deformations due
            to the
            improvement of stress transfer, allowing the prevention of premature failure caused by traffic loads. As a
            complement,
            the segments and tie bars help to effectively and durably contain the movements of the element caused by
            non-uniform
            temperature changes, i.e. warping stresses.
        </p>

        <p>
            These stresses are the ones that are most present in the slabs since even without a vehicle passing over it,
            it is already
            working alone due to the action of the thermal gradient (ΔT) that generates high temperature in the upper
            part of the
            slab and low in the lower part and vice versa, taking a concave or convex shape, a disposition that
            generates additional
            major stresses.

        <!-- Conclusiones -->
        <hr>

        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
        <p>
            When designing a rigid pavement, the procedure for obtaining input data must be carried out with caution,
            since it is
            these data that determine whether or not the structure complies with the calculated N design.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is important to see that the contact area is one of the most representative factors when modeling in
            EverFe since it
            represents how the load can be transferred from the shafts to the slabs.
        </p>

        <p>
            The finite element modeling allows obtaining results closer to reality, as it is reflected in the increase
            of the magnitude
            determined by EverFe in comparison with the manual analytical methods. This increase becomes a "safety
            factor"
            which, if it is not foreseen in the design process of the structure in the phase of checking the slabs, will
            cause an early
            failure of the slabs because the stresses caused by the level of traffic will be higher than estimated.
        </p>

        <p>
            Deflexiones, Dovelas, Elementos Finitos, Esfuerzos, EverFe, Losas de concreto, Pavimento rígido.The
            three-dimensional analysis provided by EverFe allows for better visualization of the stresses and
            deflections
            generated in the slab. For this visualization to be more in line with reality, it requires that the results
            obtained are more
            accurate and in the need to optimize the collection of information, meshing plays a very important role.
            Making a
            relation of previous research on the modeling in this type of software, the division of the layers should be
            between 16
            and 32 with an optimum of 24 in x - y, and 3 in z; since it is verified that the modeling of 24 onwards, the
            results of
            efforts and deflections become similar with the low difference between them because it is not justified to
            model with 32 divisions that demand more time and computational capacity if the same results will be
            obtained if it is modeled
            with 24 divisions.
        </p>

        <p>
            It was found that the finite element modeling, allows to adequately represent the behavior of the segments
            and tie bars
            since the largest decrease was detected in the deflections with a reduction of about 71%. It shows that this
            load transfer
            system is very effective in helping the slab to adequately support the traffic loads.
        </p>

        <p>
            By analyzing the stresses and deflections at the points of interest (corner, interior, and edge), it could
            be deduced
            that the section of the slab that suffers most from warping and traffic load effects is the corner.
            Therefore, this point
            is critical when mentioning the structural failures of the slabs since it is the most susceptible to
            stresses; causing this
            to be the initial point for failure, generating corner cracks, which is one of the most common pathologies
            in rigid
            pavements.
        </p>

        <p>
            When the set of slabs was considered, the stress due to traffic load increased in all the evaluation points
            and in a more
            significant way in the corner showing the real behavior of the pavement; demonstrating that it is one of the
            most
            critical points, but less studied, so it is necessary to carry out more detailed investigations to explain
            this phenomenon.
            As the serviceability values in the two scenarios were less than the permissible values, it can be said that
            the structure
            will perform adequately and will adequately support the number of load repetitions during its entire service
            life. To
            have a more realistic idea of the behavior of the pavement structure, the serviceability values of the
            second scenario
            should be taken into account since this is the way the structure will be built and operated during its
            service life
