        <p>
            Japan is an island country in East Asia. It´is located between the Pacific Ocean and the Sea
            of Japan, Russia, and the Korean peninsula. Known as «The land of the rising sun», it is one of the
            greatest economic powers in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            Japan is made up of four main islands: Honshū, Hokkaidō, Kyūshū, and Shikoku, which
            make up 97% of the country's total area. It has a population of 127 million people, the tenth-largest
            in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            The metropolitan area of Tokyo, is the largest urban area in the world in terms of population,
            hosting more than 30 million inhabitants. Japan is the second-most populous country in East Asia,
            after China. (Wikipedia, Wikipedia)
        </p>

        <p>
            From the end of the 12th century (1192) to the 17th century (1603) Japan was led by
            samurai, but their politicians were unstable and the rebellions and struggles by proxy; finally,
            Tokugawa managed to defeat their rivals and to establish for imposing his hegemony, which was
            last until the Meiji Restoration (1868). (hane, 2000).
        </p>

        <p>
            During this period, conditions were created in Japan for further industrialization and
            modernization.
        </p>

        <p>
            These conditions can be synthesized into:
        </p>

        <ul class="lista">
            <li>Political unity and stability. </li>
            <li>Development of agriculture. </li>
            <li>Development of transport and national markets.
            </li>
            <li>The boom in trade, finance, and a wealthy merchant class. </li>
            <li>Growth of manufacturing activities such as crafts and feed.</li>
            <li>Industrial promotion by local governments.</li>
            <li>High level of education. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Xenophobic nationalism was very intense at the beginning, but Japan realized that the West
            was much more modern and powerful and the internal struggles focused on how to end the bakufu
            and establish a new government, governed by young samurai. Finally, the forces of the military
            government were defeated and imperial power restored, the emperor was the rightful head of state,
            moving from Kyoto, the former imperial capital, which became Tokyo where the new Meiji
            government was established, in 1868.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Japanese development model is based on the Meiji Restoration, a pragmatic reaction
            by the Japanese nobility to confront the Western powers that were imposing themselves on East
            Asia in the mid-19th century through unequal trade agreements because of their military
            superiority. This was a real revolution that changed the economic, territorial, political, and, in part,
            social system. This unique historical fact marked the key points of the Japanese model. (Lobo)
        </p>

        <p>
            The great military and economic capacity of the powers admired by Japan rested on the
            exploitation of their colonies; this fierce expansionism ceased with their defeat in World War II and the
            occupation of Japan by the United States, which forced a pacifist constitution that
            prohibited war, the maintenance of an army and colonialism. However, when the goals of the Meiji
            restoration seemed more unattainable than ever, what was later called the Japanese miracle
            occurred. Where the economic path was the only way to make its way in the international sphere
            and away from any international obligations, Japan concentrated its energies on reinventing its
            industry and leaving behind the prevailing military production along with its violent past. Between
            1950 and 1980, Japan grew at an average of 8.5% per year. By the 1980s, speculation that it would
            become the world's leading economic power was already the order of the day. Japan was finally
            achieving its historic goal and proving that the economic development and prestige that its efforts
            had brought. (Ramos).
        </p>

        <p>
            At the beginning of the new decade, the bubble burst. Rising interest rates caused the price
            of land to finally collapse and lead to a disastrous financial situation. The next event was the
            collapse of the Japanese stock market, so companies began to have problems getting financing
            (Economia)
        </p>

        <p>
            The truth is that it was not until the new millennium that the economy of this Asian country
            began to glimpse recovery. With this new boom, the Japanese have managed to maintain a better
            balance of their economy, especially relying on technological development that keeps them as a
            world power, and its GDP is above many developed countries.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Economy, Import and Export </p>

        <p>
            The agricultural sector is very old, with the average age of the farmer being over sixty.
            Production is atomized, with an average area per farm of fewer than two hectares. Over the past
            few decades, Japan has removed some barriers that limited access to its agricultural markets.
        </p>

        <p>
            Its strength lies in its technological development and the size of some of its companies.
            Japanese companies maintain a considerable market share in world markets but are limited in their
            expansion by the price competitiveness of other countries. The industry, therefore, seeks to position
            itself in the segment where technological innovation and high quality make a competitive
            difference, for that Japan is the third biggest economy in the world, it´s a country with a lot of
            opportunities. The main Industries are telecommunications, electronic equipment, automotive
            production which is one of his highest potentialities.
        </p>

        <p>
            The economic growth of this country is due to the governmental alliances and industrial
            alliances which allowed economic freedom, his main commercial countries associates are United
            States, China, European Union, South Korea, and Hong Kong. Japan has limited natural resources,
            this country imports most raw materials, alimentary products, fossil Fuels, cereals textiles, among
            others.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Relationship between Colombia and Japan </p>

        <p>
            Colombia is a market that offers security and confidence, and commercial opportunities in
            sectors such as infrastructure, renewable energy, investment funds, agribusiness, infrastructure in
            tourism, and the orange economy. (procolombia)
        </p>

        <p>
            "Colombia is a very important country for us. It is a prosperous market of 45 million people
            and it is the third-largest economy in Latin America. In Colombia, many Japanese companies are
            doing different activities with security and confidence (...) Also, in May 2018, Colombia joined the
            OECD. This is evidence of the progress where Colombia is experiencing, (Kobayashi, s.f.)
        </p>

        <p>
            “Our relationship with Japan is going through a magnificent moment. We share instruments
            to strengthen the bilateral relationship such as the Reciprocal Investment Protection Agreement
            (APRI) and the Agreement to avoid double taxation, signed by Chancellor Carlos Holmes Trujillo
            in Tokyo, Furthermore, we work with strategic allies such as the Japanese Trade Promotion Agency
            (JETRO),” said Flavia Santoro, president of ProColombia (Santoro)
        </p>

        <p>
            In turn, the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan in Colombia,
            (Morishita), said: "We know that Colombia is a country with great potential, it is an important
            market. The Colombian Government has sent a message that we share: we must have a greater
            connection through free trade and that is why we want to have a greater commitment to using public
            and private funds to boost SMEs. Besides, we have a connection of values: Colombia is based on
            the regulations of the legal state and this is a component that we are working together in the WTO.
        </p>

        <p>
            Japan is the main issuer of Foreign Investment from Asia - Pacific to Colombia. It has
            accumulated the US $ 485 million in the last decade, according to reports from the Banco de la
            República's Balance of Payments. The amounts of the invested capital can be considered higher
            than the official ones, given that some Japanese companies have invested through subsidiaries
            located in third countries. This investment, the largest in Venture Capital in Latin America, will
            support Rappi's expansion in the region.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, opportunities have been identified in sectors as varied as infrastructure, renewable
            energy, investment funds, agribusiness, infrastructure in tourism, and the orange economy. In 2018,
            Colombia's total exports to Japan reached the US $ 474 million. Among nonmining energy exports,
            the products that reached this country the most were green coffee, fresh and preserved flowers,
            products derived from coffee, cocoa toppings, and organic products.
        </p>

        <p>
            As for tourism, last year Colombia received 8,137 Japanese travelers and today it is
            estimated that there is enormous potential for Japanese travelers in niches such as culture (heritage
            destinations, gastronomy, fairs, and festivals) and nature in general (unique landscapes of the
            world). (Procolombia)
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Meeting Places</p>

        <p>
            The first appointment is better if you can get an intermediary, the decision makes simpler,
            preferably this person has to be chooser with great care for tradition the Japanese's are loyal to their
            partners if you can’t get an intermediary you should book the appointments
            By a phone call is possible that a letter or an e-mail don’t have the same effect.

            is don´t put them in your pocket or your wallet, this isn´t seen well so is better that you avoid doing
            this and avoid show shock or anger during business negotiations, they will think that you have lack
            self-control and you probably won't be the right partner and avoid prolonged direct eye contact.

            It’s Important to identify the more important people, the Japanese business culture is
            hierarchical and this determines the location at the table, the tum to talk and the decision making,
            after fifteen minutes they would like to know more about you, the Japanese give a lot of importance
            to the people, to their behavior, to their manners that's why you express your release usually the
            Japanese's keeping silence during the meeting's, and that they can concentrate better in what they are
            listening and make the better final decision, they pay a lot of attention to body languages like

            In Japanese culture, group conception and hierarchical relations are essential in society and
            business. This cultural pattern has its foundations in Confucianism, a thought that holds that people
            are ordered vertically. Thus, hierarchical relationships are established as follows: customer (top)
            and salesperson (bottom), head office (top) and branch (bottom), boss (top) and subordinate
            (bottom), senior or person with more seniority in the company (top) and junior (bottom).

            It is true that Japan is a highly robotic society and that machines have replaced humans in
            many jobs, such as in the manufacturing industry and restaurants and hotels, but this evolution has
            not been enough to meet the labor needs of the Asian country, which has had to relax its rigid
            immigration laws in the face of the need for human workers.

        <p>
            In Japan the people usually work eight hours daily with one hours-break to lunch, some big
            industries and big chain stores work on weekends, usually, these are closes during one week in the
            new year, in golden week celebration, at the end of April or beginnings of May and in the Obon
            festival at mid-august.

        <p>
            Some private companies in the country have launched their programs. For a little less than
            two years now, Yahoo Japan has been offering its staff to take three days off a week to improve
            their productivity. The initiative is not new. It was launched at the beginning of the last century
            and is now beginning to re-emerge as a way of reducing public stress and environmental impact.

        <p class="titulo">Business Practices</p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Business Typical Costume</p>

        <p>
            Japanese's are conservative people at the time of dressing, usually, the men wear dark suits,
            like grey color or dark blue coral, brown color is not recommendable, white shirts, dark ties without
            lines or details and dark shoes, and dark shoes, in the case of women dark tailors it, can be with trousers
            or skirts but not too short, sneakers not too high and a little of makeup. You shouldn't wear
            extravagant clothes nor sports clothes, at least that your Parmer dedicates to fashion design.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Business</p>

        <p>
            At the beginning of the meetings, business card exchange is considered important, is
            impolite not to do it, the card has to be written in both languages. Japanese and for example
            Columbian depend on the country of origin, you have to try to focus on the old people inside the
            meetings room it means respect in Japan and then you can focus on the others, it´s probably they
            ask about your life, about your family, the education, the salary, because are important things to
            them. If maybe you don´t want to answer never lose your respect focus and gratitude, it´s necessary
            don´t argue during frost minutes of the conversation. The reputation of the enterprise is very
            important in the Japanese market, start with punctuality. The Japanese value time. If you aren´t a
            punctual person this could damage your image and don´t forget the tips on the previous page, you
            can get a plus point with a gift which is a gesture very appreciated by businessmen in Japan, but
            don´t worry it doesn´t matter if it´s luxurious or not, it´s big or small, what matters is the detail and
            the way that is given it´s known like "Hoso" where is so important the way deliver it and the way
            to pack it as much as the gift itself. You have to give him (the Japanese businessman) with both
            hands and you have to take a bow. The businessman may reject it several times before receiving it.
            Remember that in Japan the hierarchy must be respected if the gift is given in public you have to
            realize the higher charges into the organization, preferably deliver the gifts at the end of the
            meeting, and then these will be opened.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Another recommendation is “BE PATIENT” an intelligent because in Japan</p>

        <p>
            Entrepreneurs give the feeling that they don´t have clear answers about the interest, that´s
            why you need to be patient, the Japanese will not tell you what they are expected of you, so don´t
            do anything indirectly always be direct with what you say, and finally, you could achieve business
            with the Japanese, and always keep a smile even if you are upset.
